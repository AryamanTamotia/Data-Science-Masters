    "The main differences between SQL and NoSQL databases are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Model: SQL databases use a table-based model, while NoSQL databases use a document-based or key-value model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Query Language: SQL databases use the SQL language to query data, while NoSQL databases use different query languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Scalability: SQL databases are vertically scalable, meaning that they can handle increased workload by increasing the hardware capacity. NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, meaning that they can handle increased workload by adding more servers to the database cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Consistency: SQL databases offer strong consistency, meaning that all clients see the same view of the data at the same time. NoSQL databases offer eventual consistency, meaning that all clients eventually see the same view of the data, but not necessarily at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Schema: SQL databases have a fixed schema, meaning that the structure of the data is defined beforehand. NoSQL databases have a dynamic schema, meaning that the structure of the data can be changed on-the-fly."
